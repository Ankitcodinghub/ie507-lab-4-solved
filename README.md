Instructions:

We will practice modeling optimization problems by loading information from files in this lab. We will also continue modeling problems with integer variables.

To load directly from a .txt file containing numbers, we will use the numpy.loadtxt() construct. To know more on the numpy methods to load from files, please check https://numpy.org/doc/ stable/reference/routines.io.html.

To load directly from a file with comma separated values (.csv file), we will use pandas library. The construct pandas.read csv helps to read contents from a .csv file. Please check https: //pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/getting_started/index.html to know more about pandas library.

Please follow the instructions given below:

<ul>
<li>Please use different notebooks for solving different problems.</li>
<li>The notebook name for Exercise 1 should be YOURROLLNUMBER IE507 Lab4 Ex1.ipynb.</li>
<li>Similarly, the notebook name for Exercise 2 should be YOURROLLNUMBER IE507 Lab4 Ex2.ipynb,
etc.
</li>
<li>Please post your doubts in MS Teams or Moodle so that TAs can clarify.
For more details on pyomo, please consult https://pyomo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index. html.

There are only 3 exercises in this lab. Try to solve all problems on your own. If you have difficulties, ask the Instructors or TAs.

Only the questions marked [R] need to be answered in the notebook. You can either print the answers using print command in your code or you can write the text in a separate text tab. To add text in your notebook, click +Text. Some questions require you to provide proper explanations; for such questions, write proper explanations in a text tab.

After completing this lab‚Äôs exercises, click File ‚Üí Download .ipynb and save your files to your local laptop/desktop. Create a folder with name YOURROLLNUMBER IE507 Lab4 and copy your .ipynb files to the folder. Then zip the folder to create YOURROLLNUMBER IE507 Lab4.zip. Then upload only the .zip file to Moodle.

The deadline for today‚Äôs lab submission is tomorrow, 10th September 2020, 11 59 PM Indian Standard Time (IST).

Exercise 3: Another Exercise on LP Vs MILP [20 marks]

The simplest application of MILP is when the variables model discrete objects that can only take whole-number values (e.g. number of drones to manufacture). The Indian Air Force (IAF) has planned to purchase drones from the Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) for using them in surveillance activities and during crisis situations like floods, fires and earthquakes. The drones are expected to carry cameras and freight. Five different types of drones are available with HAL. Their carrying capacities, costs and parking space requirements are listed below:

4 2.75 4.5 2.5

</div>
</div>
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
The IAF wants to have maximum possible carrying capacity. The budget of IAF is limited to 29 crores of rupees. In addition, parking space for drones is limited to 37 sq. m.

<ol>
<li>Create a .csv file containing the data given in the table. Name the file as lab4 ex3.csv. Use simple and appropriate names for the headers.</li>
<li>Copy the file to colab environment.</li>
<li>Use pandas to load the .csv file contents.</li>
<li>[R] Write a mathematical optimization problem to find the number of drones of each type that can be bought in order to maximize the goal. Mention which variables must be integers.</li>
<li>Create a model using pyomo to solve your optimization problem. Use the loaded contents of .csv file to create your model. Use cbc solver to solve your optimization problem. In your code, remember to specify which variables are integers.</li>
<li>[R] Report the optimal objective function value and the solution.</li>
<li>[R] Let us now compare it to a linear program. Suppose we remove the restrictions that the variables in the above problem are integers. Solve this modified problem and report the solution and the objective value.</li>
<li>[R] Can the solution of the MILP be obtained by merely rounding the solution of the LP? Why or why not?</li>
<li>[R] Suppose now we are interested in finding how the solution changes when the right-hand- sides in our constraints change. Suppose the limit on budget is increased to 41 units and the parking space is increased to 47 units, how will the new LP objective value change? How does the new MILP objective value change?</li>
<li>[R] Now try decreasing limit on budget from 41 units to 39, 37, 35 and 33 units. Correspond- ingly, increase the parking space to 49, 51, 53 and 55 units. Solve the LP and MILP for each of these four possiblities and comment on the pattern seen in objective values of the LP and MILP.</li>
